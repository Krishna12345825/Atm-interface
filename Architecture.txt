1. User Interface (UI) Layer:

- This layer handles user interactions and displays information to the users.
- It can be implemented using technologies like core Java and SQL.

2. Business Logic Layer:

- This layer contains the business rules and logic of the application.
- It handles the processing and manipulation of data.
- It communicates with the data access layer to fetch and store data.
- It validates user input and enforces business rules.
- This layer can be implemented using Java classes and interfaces.


3. Data Access Layer:

- This layer is responsible for interacting with the database.
- It performs database operations such as querying, inserting, updating, and deleting data.
- It encapsulates the database-specific operations and provides a consistent interface to the business logic layer.
- JDBC (Java Database Connectivity) can be used to connect to the database and execute SQL queries.


4. Database:

- This layer stores the application data.
- It can be implemented using a relational database management system (RDBMS) like MySQL.
- Tables are created to represent entities such as banks, departments, etc., and relationships are established using primary and foreign keys.
