      The wireframe provides a visual representation of the project's functionality and layout, which can help you plan and implement your
       project more efficiently.

The task list component displays a list of tasks, such as Task 1, Task 2, Task 3, and Task 4. This list can be populated by retrieving data from a MySQL database using Core Java.

The task details component initially displays no information, but when a task is selected from the task list, it will show the details of the selected task. These details can also be retrieved from the MySQL database based on the selected task.

This wireframe provides a basic visual representation of the project structure and user interface. From here, you can start implementing the project using Core Java and MySQL.
